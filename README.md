# SimpleLoginSystem V1
```Simple Login System``` is a project I used to practice an imperative programming principle: databases. This project is very basic. 
It prompts a user to *sign up, login, or exit* the program at initalization. If the user signs up, it allows them to enter a username and password
(with no restrictions on either). Once signed up, the user can choose to login, in which they are asked to enter these credentials for verification of a successful login. 
# Running The Program
The ```EdisonYCA/SimpleLoginSystem``` repository contains all of the files required to run this program. Keep in mind that this is a foundation project (meaning it will be used
to implement a much more efficent and reliable program in the future) so it is prone to bugs or errors. Simply download the repo and run ```main.py``` when ready.
